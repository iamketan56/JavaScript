# JavaScript
<b>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class function.</b><br><br>

<h1 align-item:center>DOM CONCEPT</h1><br>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed<br><br>
<b>Level of DOM</b><br>
DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, including the means to change any portion of the document.<br>
DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the getElementById function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS.<br>
DOM Level 3, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML.<br>
DOM Level 4 was published in 2015. It is a snapshot of the WHATWG living standard.<br><br>
